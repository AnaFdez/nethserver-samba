#             This boolean parameter controls whether Samba implments  the  CIFS  UNIX  extensions,  as
#             defined  by  HP.  These extensions enable Samba to better serve UNIX CIFS clients by sup-
#             porting features such as symbolic links, hard links, etc... These  extensions  require  a
#             similarly enabled client, and are of no current use to Windows clients.

# Enabling unix extensions causes a lot of problems with file and directory
# permissions in i-bays (reported with OS X clients). We disable them.
